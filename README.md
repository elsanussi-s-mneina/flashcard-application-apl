# flashcard-application-apl
A program that lets a person study flashcards, implemented in APL.

This is mainly a programming exercise for learning the APL language.



## Installing APL

https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/apl.html

Download GNU apl 1.8.

Untar the download. You should have a folder.

Go inside that folder.

Run 

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

## Running the program
$ ./run.sh

If that does not work open the file run.sh in a text editor, and try the commands contained therein at your terminal.

## After running the program type the following to close it:
)OFF

## Running the tests
$ ./test.hs

## After running the test type the following to close it:
)OFF

I doubt there is a unit testing framework, so I just use a number to indicate how many tests passed.

## Exiting APL
Type The contents of the following 
")OFF" exactly without quotes and press enter.
